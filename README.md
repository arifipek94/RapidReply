**Important Notes for your GitHub Repository:**

1.  **Upload the images to your repository:** Make sure to upload the screenshots you provided (e.g., `Screenshot 2025-06-20 184642.png`, `Screenshot 2025-06-20 192235.png`, etc.) to your GitHub repository. A common practice is to create an `images` or `assets` folder and put them there, then update the image paths in the README accordingly (e.g., `images/Screenshot 2025-06-20 184642.png`). For now, I've used the direct filenames you provided in your prompt.
2.  **Replace the GIF placeholder:** You still have the line `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/demo.gif` in your original README. I've removed it and replaced it with individual image embeds. If you create a GIF in the future, you can re-add it or replace the image section with it.
3.  **File Naming:** Ensure the image filenames in the README exactly match the filenames you upload to your GitHub repository. If you rename them (e.g., to something more descriptive like `rapidreply-button.png`), remember to update the `![Alt Text](filename.png)` links in the README.
